  	<h1> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO PUT HERE </h1>
	<h2> So here's some CCR lyrics </h2>
	<p> Well take me back down where cool water flows, yeah <br>
Let me remember things I love <br>
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite <br>
Walkin' along the river road at night <br>
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight <br>
<br>
I can hear the bullfrog callin' me <br>
Wonder if my rope's still hanging to the tree<br>
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water<br>
Shoefly, dragonfly get back t'your mother<br>
Pick up a flat rock, skip it accross Green River<br>
Wellllll!<br>
<br>
Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh<br>
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers<br>
Old Cody, Junior took me over<br>
Said, "You're gonna find the world is smould'rin<br>
And if you get lost come on home to Green River." <br></p>

<br> <br>
	<h2> Actually I need more lyrics to show off how the header <br> stays on screen when scrolling, have some King Crimson. </h2>
	<p> Sundown dazzling day <br>
Gold through my eyes<br>
But my eyes turned within only see<br>
<br>
Starless and bible black<br>
<br>
Old friend charity<br>
Cruel twisted smile<br>
And the smile signals emptiness for me<br>
<br>
Starless and bible black<br>
<br>
Ice blue silver sky<br>
Fades into grey<br>
To a grey hope that all years to be<br>
<br>
Starless and bible black<br></p>
